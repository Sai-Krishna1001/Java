Method References
========================
--> Method reference is used to refer method of the functional interface.
	It is compact and easy form a lambda expression.
-->	Each time when you are using a lambda expression to just referring a method,
	You can replace your lambda expression with a method reference.

Example:
	Printable printableLambda = (String msg) -> System.out.println(msg);
	printableLambda.print("Hello");
	
	Above replaces with Below
	
	Printable printable = System.out::println;
	printable.print("Hello");
